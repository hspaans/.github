# Security Policy

This document describes the security policy for all of the repositories within
the [github.com/hspaans](github.com/hspaans) namespace. All these repositories
are maintained on best effort basis and the security policy is subject to
change.

## Supported Versions

### Published Releases

Only the most recent version per protected branch is supported and considered
for accepting merge requests. Legacy versions are not considered for accepting
merge requests.

### Dependencies

Dependencies are monitored and updated automatically with [Dependabot] and
follow upstream offert versions closely as possible.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Vulnerabilities in upstream code and/or packages need to be reported to the
maintainer responsible and will be managed via their security announcements.
